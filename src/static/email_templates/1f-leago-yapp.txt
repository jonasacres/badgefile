<h3>Costume Night</h3>
<p>On Pair Go night, Thursday (7/17), it is somewhat of tradition to wear a costume or dress-up as you wish.  In fact, you can wear whatever you want all day.  We don’t care.</p>

<h3>Education Track - Update</h3>
<p>Last week, we shared information about the Education Track.  Here are two flyers you may find useful:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>One is for Congress participants called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8AxxP4hjdw5FvYaF4JSWSAx8yvVNoDU/view?usp=share_link">Education Workshop</a>.</li>
<li>The other is geared toward educators interested in bringing the game of Go into the classroom called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vEFEgGueevkC5AuHxg6ojjXuP2Xc9GOW/view?usp=share_link">Education Workshop (Hybrid)</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We encourage you to share the second flyer with any teachers or others who might be interested in learning about Go.</p>

<p>You’ll receive one final email from us before the Congress, which will include a printable Congress Guide and final instructions for navigating the Austin airport, getting to campus, and checking in.</p>

<p><b>See y’all in Texas!</b></p>
