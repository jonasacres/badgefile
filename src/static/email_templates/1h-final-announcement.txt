<h3>Navigating the Airport</h3>

<p>Due to some on-going remodeling, the exit from the gate area to the baggage claim an sometimes be difficult to find. It is across from Gate 18-19. You will then go down the escalator to baggage claim. There is an information desk near Baggage Claim 5. We will have greeters near that information desk during the most popular arrival times.</p>

<p>The greeters will help you find other attendees who would like to share a ride with you and help you find your way to the ride share pick-up area.</p>

<p>You should provide your ride share app/driver with the following address to get to Southwestern University and the <b>McCombs Campus Center</b> where check-in will take place:</p>
