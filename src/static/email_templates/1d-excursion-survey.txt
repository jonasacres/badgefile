Subject: Go Congress Excursions and Wednesday Plans

<p>Only three weeks to go!</p>

<p>As most of you know, Wednesday is an 'off-day' at the congress. Many people use this day to explore the surrounding area. Of course, you can stay on campus and participate in Go-related activities such as the popular Die Hard tournament.</p>

<p>Please read the information below and then <b>respond to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScj8Rwkh7PNypaxZ8BrUIloiDtWG7Sq6QOwrbKyjx4tGzdJzQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=102824687675566317967">short survey</a></b> to help us provide you with a great experience in Austin.</p>

<p>If you want that day off, information on what sites we think you may enjoy can be found on the <a href="https://usgo.org/Excursions">Excursions page</a> of the <a href="https://gocongress.org">gocongress.org</a> web site.</p>

<p>There are MANY exciting things to do in downtown Austin… a 30-40 minute drive from Southwestern University. At the time I am writing this (10:00AM on a Thursday), Lyft is quoting me around $40 for the ride.</p>

<p>There are many museums, the Texas State Capitol building, various historic landmarks and parks….many of which are listed in the <a href="https://usgo.org/Excursions">Excursions</a> page referenced above.</p>

<p>Closer to Southwestern are many sites in and around Georgetown, including Inner Space Caverns and various hiking, shopping and other activities.</p>

<p>To help us make your Wednesday experience the best it can be. Please answer this <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScj8Rwkh7PNypaxZ8BrUIloiDtWG7Sq6QOwrbKyjx4tGzdJzQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=102824687675566317967">short survey</a></b> with your current plans regarding excursions and lunch. We understand your plans may change once you arrive at the Congress.</p>

<p>Though there are many fun and exciting things to do in Austin and the surrounding area, <b>attendees will need to manage their own transportation to these sites</b>. We will have sign up sheets and will help identify groups of people with similar interests so they can share rides through ride-shares or taxis.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see you at the 41st US Go Congress!</p>
