</ul></p>

<p>And now for some of the special events:</p>

<h3>Yoga</h3>

<p>For the first time ever at US Go Congress, enjoy free beginners yoga and meditation sessions, brought to you by Isha Foundation!  In these free sessions, offered morning and afternoon of each day of the Congress, learn simple yet powerful yoga postures and meditation practices to bring stability and balance to your system.  These gentle asanas suitable for many body types help relieve chronic ailments and stress, for health, clarity, and joy.  Great for all abilities and ages 7+ or 12+ depending on the session; no previous experience of yoga or meditation necessary.  Please bring your own yoga mat or cushion.  Isha Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to cultivating human wellbeing, and founded by Sadhguru, a yogi, mystic, and visionary.  Isha Foundation has been offering tools for wellbeing from the science of yoga to people from all walks of life, supported by 17 million volunteers worldwide in the last four decades.</p>

<h3>Education Track</h3>

<p>The Education Track at the US Go Congress supports participants on a journey from “I can play” to “I can share” and finally “I can teach.” It offers two levels of programming:</p>

<p><b>Level 1</b>: I can share – Focused on helping Go players develop the skills and confidence to teach Go to friends, family members, colleagues, and community members. (Example: “I can introduce Go to 10 people each year.”)</p>
<p><b>Level 2</b>: I can teach – Designed for those who want to promote Go more broadly, with training in instructional strategies for different settings and levels, and the opportunity to earn a teaching certificate. (Example: “I can teach Go to 100 people each year.”)</p>

<h4>Current Structure</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>10-hour training session delivered over 5 days during the Congress</li>
<li>Participants who complete at least 8 hours of training are eligible to receive an AGA Teacher Certificate</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Movie Nights</h3>

<p>In the campus theater, we will be showing two movies:
<ul>
<li><b>The Match</b> (Wednesday night): A drama based on two real-life Go professionals. The film tells the story of Cho Hun-hyun, who discovers Lee Chang-ho as a gifted but untrained 9 year-old in an amateur contest. Cho takes Lee under his wing to turn him into a professional player. Conflicts arise when the protégé turns against his teachings. Their rivalry and the eventual dominance of Lee Chang-ho form a significant chapter in the history of Go.</li>
<li><b>AlphaGo</b> (Friday night): The film presents how AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google's DeepMind, mastered the game of Go through artificial intelligence. Its competence was tested by Lee Sedol, a South Korean world champion.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>SmartGo</h3>

<p>SmartGo author Anders Kierulf answers all your questions about SmartGo One and Go Books. Learn how to use SmartGo One to play against KataGo, record and analyze your own games, study pro games, analyze joseki, solve problems, read go books, and more.</p>

<p>The last part of the session will be audience reviews of Go Books.  Bring a story of which e-book is your favorite one.</p>

<h3>Lecture by Jinhoo (Jake) Kim - “Don’t just Play Go - Live Go”</h3>

<p>Two key themes: the decline of Go’s popularity, and how it can be revitalized as an educational tool in multigenerational settings. The impact of alternative entertainment is examined. I then argue that Go should be valued not just as a game but as a tool for education. In my case, this means using Go as a dementia prevention program for seniors. Finally, my presentation encourages the audience to go beyond just playing Go—to Do Go, actively seeking ways to use it for positive community impact.</p>
