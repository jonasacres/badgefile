Subject: Go Congress Housing Reminder (Corrected)

<p>Dear {name_given},</p>

<p>Earlier today, we sent you an e-mail with a link to indicate your housing preference. Unfortunately, this link was broken. This corrected email has a working link for you, and we apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>Please make sure to sign up for Housing on the Congress website so that the Registrar team can help assign & verify your room(s). This year we have dorm & apartment style room(s) options available, and youâ€™ll also be able to write in a roommate request if you have one. You can find our housing options here:</p>

<p>If you plan to make your own arrangements for housing, please let us know by going to this link:</p>

<p><a href="https://registration.gocongress.org/attendees/{hash_id}/confirm_housing">https://registration.gocongress.org/attendees/{hash_id}/confirm_housing</a>

<p>Checking "I will arrange my own off-campus housing" on this form will stop further housing reminder e-mails.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel reach to reach out to the Registrar at registrar@gocongress.org.</p>

<p>Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you in July!</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Registrar Team<br />
