Subject: Re: ACTION REQUIRED: Youth forms needed for members of your party

<p>Hello, {name_given}!</p>

<p>Earlier this evening, we accidentally sent you an e-mail advising you that we are awaiting youth forms for members of your party. Due to a technical glitch, we inadvertantly sent this e-mail to many participants whose youth paperwork is already in order.</p>

<p>Our records show that your youth forms are already on file, and no further action is needed on this matter. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>Thank you for coming to the Go Congress, and we are very excited to see you!<br />
