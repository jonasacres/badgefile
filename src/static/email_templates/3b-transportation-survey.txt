Subject: Transportation for Go Congress Attendees

<p>To help us plan for your transportation between the Austin airport and the Go Congress at Southwestern University, please fill out this <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUh_SJ9i7NipSmYdi-FLmtOepR-qQLalY_-0fAZrufEhAzwg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1150149530=1&entry.271221079=YES&entry.861395713=NO&entry.499459736=Saturday+July+12th&entry.2090038947=Sunday+July+20th">brief form.</a></b></p>

<p>At this time, the most cost effective way for you to get to Southwestern University from the airport (and back) will be through ride shares. A typical ride share is expected to cost $70-$90.</p>

<p>We plan to have greeters at the airport to help group multiple attendees as they arrive so that 3-4 people can share the ride (and cost) to get to the congress.</p>

<p>By filling out the form, we will have a better idea of the distribution of arrivals (and departures) so that we can make this process as smooth and simple for you as possible. If you are travelling with others on the same flight, you could share a ride with them... or be paired up with others arriving at a similar time.</p>

<p>Even if you are not arriving by air, please fill out the first part of the form so that we have a better idea of the total number of attendees coming via various modes of transportation.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for taking a minute to provide us with this information. We will be in touch over the next month with more details about various aspects of the congress.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:director@gocongress.org">director@gocongress.org</a>.</p>

<p>We are excited to see you here in Texas. Safe travels!</p>

<p>Bart Jacob - Co-director<br />
